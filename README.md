This project is an end-to-end bioinformatics web application that visualizes a protein sequence and its predicted 3D structure side-by-side in a single Streamlit window.
Users can input a protein amino acid sequence (FASTA format), and the application:
Displays the raw sequence and basic properties
Predicts the 3D protein structure
Renders an interactive 3D visualization
All within one unified UI.
This project is ideal for demonstrating skills in:
Structural Bioinformatics
Protein Folding
Deep Learning in Biology
Scientific Web Applications
